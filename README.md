No more screenshots!

##Usage

In Textmate select text press Cmd+Shift+C, then go to Keynote and paste with Cmd+V

##Installation

	mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy
	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Pristine\ Copy/
	git clone -b textmate-2 https://github.com/sandropaganotti/copy-with-style-tmbundle.git "Copy with Style.tmbundle"
    
To make this work remember to switch Textmate 2 chosen theme at least once in order to make the necessary preference be saved in .plist file (it's still in alpha :).

##Credits

Command code was adopted from example presented in Josh Goebel's [blog post]( http://blog.pastie.org/2008/06/textmate-to-key.html)
